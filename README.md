## 📌 Project Overview
JARVIS is a **research-oriented intelligent assistant** designed to explore fundamental concepts in **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and intelligent system design**.  
The project focuses on **context-aware intent classification** using classical machine learning techniques, with an emphasis on **explainability, modular architecture, and academic reproducibility**.

Unlike commercial assistants, JARVIS is developed as an **academic project** to study how machine learning models can be structured, evaluated, and extended in a research environment.

## 🎯 Academic Motivation
Artificial Intelligence has become a core technology shaping modern society and scientific research. This project was developed to bridge **theoretical computer science concepts** (algorithms, statistics, and formal models) with **practical AI system implementation**.

JARVIS serves as a foundation for further academic exploration in:
- Natural Language Understanding
- Intelligent Systems
- Human–Computer Interaction
- AI system architecture

   - Normalization
   - Noise removal

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)

3. **Modeling**
   - Intent classification using **Logistic Regression**

4. **System Design**
   - Modular architecture separating data handling, model training, and evaluation
   - Designed for clarity, extensibility, and academic experimentation

5. **Evaluation**
   - Performance analysis using classification accuracy
   - Error analysis for model improvement
